        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <li>
          <span class="bold bullet">Export your WhatsApp chat history</span>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On Android, you can do this by opening a chat, opening the options
            (the three dots on the top right), selecting 'More', and then
            selecting "Export Chat." If there is no option to save to your
            downloads, you could email the file to yourself and then download
            the attachment.
          </li>
          <li>
            On an iPhone, whilst in the chat to export, click on the chat name
            at the top to access settings. Scroll down until you reach "Export
            Chat"
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that in both cases, the exported chat will be saved in the form
            of a text file to your device. You can then share this file with
            others or save it for your own records.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
          <span class="bold bullet">Upload your chat history</span>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose a file with the button above, or drag the file onto this
            page! Our link extractor will scan the chat for links.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <span class="bold bullet">Click 'Download as CSV' </span>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This will download a spreadsheet file to your computer! Check the
            links below, as they might not be perfect.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can then use the list of links to do whatever you need with them!
          It's that easy!
